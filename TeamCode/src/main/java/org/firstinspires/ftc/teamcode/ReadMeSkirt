Some useful things to know about skirt

make sure you initalize before everything otherwise shit dont work, but if you initaialed previously in another class then your fine

commands

    intialize - must be called but not necessarally in that program (variables are static)

    Test motors - some random dancing shit to make sure youy plugged in your motors correctly(goes from left front clockwise)

    coninuous commands - this is for the continuous class and is the only actually impoirtant thing
    --- when using the continuos stuff, only set power  to 0 if your  done running the command'
    you must acsess the x and y but for the slope at which you want to move
    change the running boolean to false when you want it to stop moving and true when u weant it to
    every command should look like this
    also make sure that you stop the main loop w/ total running

    x =
    y =
    power =
    running = true

    wait

    running = false
    power = 0
    TOTAL_RUNNING = false
